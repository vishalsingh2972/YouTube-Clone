# Youtube-Clone

## About the Project

This project is an attempt of using intermediate HTML and CSS skills I learned and as a result apply it to build a replica of the website, YouTube.com, which I use in a daily basis as a medium to not only be entertained, but also to be informed and educated with.

## Features used in development of the project

By building the frontend of the main page of YouTube really allowed me to apply the newly learnt skills using HTML and CSS. Below are examples of the things I used to build this project:

-buttons
-spans
-divs
-classes
-transitions
-nested flexbox
-css grids
-relative and absolute positions
-plethora of CSS styling tools
