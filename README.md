# Youtube-Clone

### About the Project

This project is a clone of the popular video-sharing website YouTube.com, built using intermediate-level HTML and CSS skills.

I use YouTube.com on a daily basis not only for recreational purposes but also to stay informed and educated on various topics. As a result, building a replica of the website was an exciting challenge that allowed me to gain valuable experience in HTML and CSS.
